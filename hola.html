    <p>The time has come to an end
        Yeah, this is what nature planned
        Being tracked by a starving beast
        Looking for it's daily feast
        A predator on the verge of death
        Close to its last breath
        Getting close to its last breath
        Rules of nature
        And they run when the sun comes up
        With their lives on the line (alive)
        For all that I've (no choice)
        Gotta follow the laws of the wild (alive)
        With their lives on the line (no choice)
        Out here only the strong survive
        What's done is done
        Survived to see another day
        The game of life
        The hunter and the agile prey
        No guarantee
        Which of them will succeed?
        Strong or weak?
        Rules of nature
        Rules of nature
